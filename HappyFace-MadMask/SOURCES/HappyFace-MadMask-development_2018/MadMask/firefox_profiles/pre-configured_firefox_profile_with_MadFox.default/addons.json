It should be re-written from scratch, probably after the Convergence addon.\nI can provide guidance to anyone interested in developing it.\n\nTired of clicks for adding certificate exceptions for sites with a self-signed certificate or issued by a unknown CA ?\n\nAfter letting Firefox show it's built-in certificate error page, SkipCertError will add a temporary exception, and notify you unobtrusively.\n\nThere are very few self-explanatory options, which include the conditions of the error bypass. For now, few are supported: self-signed, issuer unknown, issuer\nuntrusted.\n\nThis add-on is a complete rewrite of MitM Me for Firefox 4 and higher. MitM Me was originally written by Johnathan Nightingale, then maintained by Andras Tim.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/59/59088.png?src=api&modified=1307610534","width":"579","height":"178","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/59/59088.png?src=api&modified=1307610534","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"61"}],"averageRating":4,"learnmoreURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/skip-cert-error/?src=api","homepageURL":"https://github.com/foudfou/skipCertError","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/307894/skip_cert_error-0.4.4-fx.xpi?src=api","size":43803,"developerComments":"    SkipCertError won't skip the cert error page when a \"valid\" cert turns out to be revoked after an OCSP query.
